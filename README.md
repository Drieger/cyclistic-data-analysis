This repository contains all the data and resources used during the capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

## Structure
The files and folders are organized in the following manner:

- **charts/** contains the charts rendered during the analysis and used in the report
- **raw/** contains the raw data collected to be analyzed
- **trips/** contains the folder structure where the unzipped files must be extracted to
- **Cyclistic - Case study.pdf** the file with study case description
- **cyclistic_data_analysis_project.Rmd** the R file the analysis steps
- **cyclistic_data_analysis_project.html** the rendered output of the R file

## How to run the R file
To correctly run the R file with the analysis you first need to extract each zip file in the **raw** folder and add the **csv** file in the correct folder under the **trips** structure.

After that just open the file in R studio and run each of the steps.

*Obs.: This is necessary due to size restrictions in place in Github, that won't allow to upload large files.*
